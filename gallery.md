Here are some demo images of the __ACDemo__ app.



## Latest version (Version 2.1)

The appearance of the app remains almost the same as __Version 2.0__. 

Only few changes have been made in this latest version:

- Add BGM :musical_note:.
- Compress images used in the app, so the size of apkâ€‹ :package: reduced from around 40MB to around 20MB.
- Implemented onUpgrade function in Database, so there will not be any exception for quiz when the user update their app directly from __Version 1.0__ to __Version 2.1__.
- :warning: However, there is still some problem for the issued _infinite_ capabilities. Please check the capabilities after installing and revoke those incorrect ones, sorry for that :sob:.
